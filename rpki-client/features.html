<p>
The global routing system of the internet consists of a number of
functionally independent actors (Autonomous Systems) which use BGP
(Border Gateway Protocol) to exchange routing information. The system is
very dynamic and flexible by design. Connectivity and routing topologies
are subject to change. Changes easily propagate globally within a few
minutes. One weakness of this system is that these changes cannot be
validated against information existing outside of the BGP protocol
itself.

RPKI is a way to define data in an out-of-band system such that the
information that is exchanged by BGP can be validated to be correct. 

RPKI allows holders of internet number resources to make verifiable
statements about how they intend to use their resources. To achieve
this, it uses a public key infrastructure that creates a chain of
resource certificates that follows the same structure as the way IP
addresses and AS numbers are handed down.

<p>
In order to satisfy those requirements, rpki-client has:

<ul>
<li>A simple and easily understandable codebase.

<li>Privilege separation that isolates the unprivileged networking
    code from the privileged time-setting code. The daemon runs
    in a chroot environment, further limiting its capabilities.

<li>Integrates the latest secure API advances from OpenBSD such as
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getentropy">getentropy(2)</a>,
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arc4random">arc4random(3)</a>
    (a fail-safe CSRNG that works in chroot environments), and
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/reallocarray">reallocarray(3)</a>
    (an integer overflow-checking malloc/calloc/realloc replacement).

</ul>
