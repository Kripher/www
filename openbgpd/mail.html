<hr>
<p>

Mailing lists are an important means of communication among users and
developers of OpenBGPD. The list is not moderated.
We deliberately restrict the number of different mailing lists.
This helps reduce the amount of cross-posting and makes sure that
the information gets distributed to a wide audience.

<h2 id="Netiquette">Netiquette</h2>

Be considerate of other subscribers on the mailing lists.

<dl>
<dt><b>Plain text, 72 characters per line</b>
<dd>Many subscribers and developers read their mail on text-based mailers
like <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mail">mail(1)</a>,
emacs or mutt, and they often find HTML-formatted messages (or lines that
stretch beyond 72 characters) unreadable.
Most OpenBSD mailing lists strip messages of MIME content before sending
them out to the rest of the list.
If you don't use plain text, your messages will be reformatted or, if they
cannot be reformatted, summarily rejected.
The only mailing lists that allow file attachments are the <b>bugs</b>,
<b>ports</b> and <b>tech</b> lists.
They will be removed from messages on the others.

<dt><b>Do your homework before you post</b>
<dd>If you have an installation question, make sure that you have read
the relevant documents, such as the relevant man pages (start with
<a href= "https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.conf">bgpd.conf(5)</a>).
We want to help, but we wouldn't want to deprive you of a valuable
learning experience, and no one wants to see the same question on the
lists for the fifth time in a month.

<dt><b>Include a useful Subject line</b>
<dd>Messages with an empty Subject will get bounced to the list manager and
will take longer to show up.
Including a relevant Subject in the message
will ensure that more people actually read what you've written.
Also, avoid Subject lines with excessive capitalization.
"Help!" or "I can't get it to work!" are not useful subject lines.
Do not change the subject line while on the same topic.
YOU may know what it is regarding, the rest of us who get several hundred
messages a day will have no idea.

<dt><b>Trim your signature</b>
<dd>Keep the signature lines at the bottom of your mail to a reasonable
length.
PGP signatures and those automatic address cards are merely annoying and
are stripped out.
Legal disclaimers and advisories are also very annoying, and inappropriate
for public mailing lists.

<dt><b>Stay on topic</b>
<dd>Please keep the subject of the post relevant to OpenBGPD.

<dt><b>Include important information</b>
<dd>Don't waste everyone's time with a hopelessly incomplete question.
No one other than you has the information needed to resolve your
problem, it is better to provide more information than needed than not
enough detail.
All questions should include at least the version of OpenBGPD.

<dt><b>Respect differences in opinion and philosophy</b>
<dd>Intelligent people may look at the same set of facts and come to very
different conclusions.
Repeating the same points that didn't convince someone previously rarely
changes their mind, and irritates all the other readers.
</dl>

<h2 id="spam">Spam</h2>

The OpenBSD lists use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd">spamd(8)</a>
and <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a> to keep down the
spam volume, but things do sneak through from time to time -- deal with it.
In addition, the list server also has regex-based rules to reject emails
based on some common spam and virus telltales.
If you get spam through one of the OpenBSD mailing lists, you don't need to
send a copy to the list owner -- chances are he's already seen it.  
Also, please do <b>not</b> submit spam received through the
mailing lists to <a href="http://spamcop.net">spamcop</a>,
as this will result in the list server being added to their RBL.
Complaining about and commenting upon spam on the list proper is
counter-productive, as it generates more traffic than the spam itself.

<p>
Note that if you are sending mail from a dynamic IP address, you
will probably <b>not</b> be able to post to the mailing lists.
In this case, you should use a <em>smart host</em> mail configuration
that utilizes your ISP's mail server.
See the examples in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.conf">smtpd.conf(5)</a> for how
to do this.

<h2 id="Lists">General User list</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>users</b>
<dd>This list is of interest to most users of OpenBGPD.
It should focused on general use questions regarding OpenBGPD,
most development will be done either on github for portable or
on the OpenBSD tech mailing list. Bug should be submitted again
to either github or the OpenBSD bugs mailing list.
</dd>

<h2 id="Majordomo">Managing list membership via Majordomo</h2>

If you want to be sent a complete list with all mailing lists available
at openbgpd.org, send the command <tt>lists</tt> in the body of
a message to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@OpenBGPD.org">majordomo@OpenBGPD.org</a>.

<p>
To subscribe to the users list, send mail to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@OpenBGPD.org">majordomo@OpenBGPD.org</a>
with a message body of "<tt>subscribe users</tt>".

<p>
For further assistance, send a message body of "help" to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@OpenBGPD.org">majordomo@OpenBGPD.org</a>
and you will receive a reply outlining all your options.
Your domain <b>must</b> resolve properly or the mail will not go through!

<h2 id="Web">Managing list membership via the web</h2>

Your membership to the OpenBGPD mailing lists can also be managed via
a web interface at <a href="https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr/domain=openbgpd.org">lists.openbsd.org</a>.

<h2 id="Tricks">Mailing list tricks</h2>

There are a number of very useful options that can be selected, either
by the <a href="https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr/domain=openbgpd.org">web interface</a> or through
<a href="mailto:majordomo@openbsd.org">Majordomo</a>.
You can change your email address without having to unsubscribe and
resubscribe, temporarily disable your message delivery for a few days
while you go on vacation and much more.
The user is invited to spend some time reading through the options, available
by sending <a href="mailto:majordomo@openbsd.org">Majordomo</a> a message
containing "help" as the body text, or through the "Help" tab of the
<a href="https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr/domain=openbgpd.org">web interface</a>.

<p>
As an example, if you were going on vacation for two weeks and didn't
wish to come back to several thousand emails, you can disable message
delivery by the mail server for the time of your vacation and have
delivery automatically resume upon your scheduled return using the command:

<blockquote><pre>
set ALL nomail-14d
</pre></blockquote>

This will suspend your subscription to all mailing lists for 14 days
(<tt>-14d</tt>).
More details and options can be seen on the 
<a href="http://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr/domain=openbgpd.org?&amp;user=&amp;passw=&amp;list=GLOBAL&amp;func=help&amp;extra=overview">
